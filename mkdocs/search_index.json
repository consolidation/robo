            "text": "Getting Started\n\n\nTo begin you need to create a RoboFile. Just run \nrobo init\n in your project directory:\n\n\ncd myproject\nrobo init\n\n\n\n\nYour project directory may start out empty; Robo will create a new \nRoboFile.php\n for you. There will be RoboFile class which extends \n\\Robo\\Tasks\n, which includes all bundled tasks of Robo.\n\n\n?php\nclass RoboFile extends \\Robo\\Tasks\n{\n}\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nCommands\n\n\nAll public methods of the RoboFile class will be treated as \ncommands\n. You can run them from the CLI and pass arguments.\n\n\n?php\nclass RoboFile extends \\Robo\\Tasks\n{\n    function hello($world)\n    {\n        $this-\nsay(\nHello, $world\n);\n    }\n}\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we run:\n\n\nrobo hello davert\n\u279c Hello, davert\n\n\n\n\nMethod names should be camelCased. In CLI \ncamelCased\n method will be available as \ncamel:cased\n command.\n\nlongCamelCased\n method will be transformed to \nlong:camel-cased\n command.\n\n\nNote:\n This assumes you have installed Robo by downloading the \nrobo.phar\n file and copied it to a directory in your \n$PATH\n. For example, \ncp robo.phar ~/bin/robo\n.\n\n\nArguments\n\n\nAll method parameters without default values are treated as required arguments. In our example command \nhello\n requires one argument.\nIf you pass a default value to parameter the argument becomes optional:\n\n\n?php\n    function hello($world = 'world')\n    {\n        $this-\nsay(\nHello, $world\n);\n    }\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nrobo hello\n\u279c Hello, world\n\n\n\n\nTo accept multiple, variable arguments, define a parameter as an \narray\n; Robo will then pass all CLI arguments in this variable:\n\n\n?php\n    function hello(array $world)\n    {\n        $this-\nsay(\nHello, \n . implode(', ', $world));\n    }\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nrobo hello davert jon bill bob\n\u279c Hello, davert, jon, bill, bob\n\n\n\n\nOptions\n\n\nTo define command options you should define the last method parameter as an associative array where the keys define the option names and the values provide each option's default values:\n\n\n?php\n    function hello($opts = ['silent' =\n false])\n    {\n        if (!$opts['silent']) $this-\nsay(\nHello, world\n);\n    }\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nrobo hello\n\u279c Hello, world\n\nrobo hello --silent\n\n\n\n\nA one-character shortcut can be specified for option:\n\n\n?php\n    function hello($opts = ['silent|s' =\n false])\n    {\n        if (!$opts['silent']) $this-\nsay(\nHello, world\n);\n    }\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nNow command can be executed with '-s' to run in silent mode: \n\n\nrobo hello -s\n\n\n\n\nThe default value for options must be one of:\n\n\n\n\nThe boolean value \nfalse\n, which indicates that the option takes no value.\n\n\nA \nstring\n containing the default value for options that may be provided a value, but are not required to.\n\n\nNULL for options that may be provided an optional value, but that have no default when a value is not provided.\n\n\nThe special value InputOption::VALUE_REQUIRED, which indicates that the user must provide a value for the option whenever it is used.\n\n\nAn empty array, which indicates that the option may appear multiple times on the command line.\n\n\n\n\nNo other values should be used for the default value. For example, \n$options = ['a' =\n 1]\n is \nincorrect\n; instead, use \n$options = ['a' =\n '1']\n. Similarly, \n$options = ['a' =\n true]\n is unsupported, or at least not useful, as this would indicate that the value of \n--a\n was always \ntrue\n, whether or not it appeared on the command line.\n\n\nLoad From Other Robofile\n\n\nRobo can execute commands from a different RoboFile, eg. located in different directory or with a different filename.\n\nYou can specify the path to another RoboFile by including the \n--load-from\n option:\n\n\nrobo run --load-from /path/to/my/other/robofile\n\n\n\n\nAdditional notes:\n\n\n\n\nThe filename can be anything; it is not limited to \nRoboFile.php\n.\n\n\nThe class name inside the file has to be the same name as the file has.\n\n\nThe class has to be in the root namespace. Eg. \nFoo.php =\n \\Foo\n\n\nThe internal current directory (cwd) of the PHP process will be switched to the directory where the provided RoboFile came from.\n\n\n\n\nPass-Through Arguments\n\n\nSometimes you need to pass arguments from your command into a task. A command line after the \n--\n characters is treated as one argument.\nAny special character like \n-\n will be passed into without change.\n\n\n?php\n    function ls(array $args)\n    {\n        $this-\ntaskExec('ls')-\nargs($args)-\nrun();\n    }\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nrobo ls -- Robo -c --all\n [Robo\\Task\\ExecTask] running ls Robo -c --all\n .  ..

An example help Doc-Block comment is shown below:\n\n\n?php\n/**\n * Calculate the fibonacci sequence between two numbers.\n *\n * Graphic output will look like\n *     +----+---+-------------+\n *     |    |   |             |\n *     |    |-+-|             |\n *     |----+-+-+             |\n *     |        |             |\n *     |        |             |\n *     |        |             |\n *     +--------+-------------+\n *\n * @param int $start Number to start from\n * @param int $steps Number of steps to perform\n * @param array $opts\n * @option $graphic Display the sequence graphically using cube\n *                  representation\n */\npublic function fibonacci($start, $steps, $opts = ['graphic' =\n false])\n{\n}\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe corresponding help text produced is:\n\n\nrobo fibonacci --help\nUsage:\n fibonacci [--graphic] start steps\n\nArguments:\n start                 Number to start from\n steps                 Number of steps to perform\n\nOptions:\n --graphic             Display the sequence graphically using cube representation\n\nHelp:\n Graphic output will look like\n     +----+---+-------------+\n     |    |   |             |\n     |    |-+-|             |\n     |----+-+-+             |\n     |        |             |\n     |        |             |\n     |        |             |\n     +--------+-------------+\n\n\n\n\nArguments and options are populated from annotations.\n\n\nInitially added with \nPR by @jonsa\n; now provided by the \nconsolidation/annotated-command\n project, which was factored out from Robo.\n\n\nIgnored methods\n\n\nRobo ignores any method of your RoboFile that begins with \nget\n or \nset\n. These methods are presumed to be data accessors, not commands.  To implement a command whose name contains \nget\n or \nset\n, use the \n@command\n annotation.\n\n\n?php\n    /**\n     * @command set-alignment\n     */\n    function setAlignment($value)\n    {\n        ...\n    }\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nTasks\n\n\nRobo commands typically divide the work they need to accomplish into \ntasks\n. The command first determines what needs to be done, inspecting current state if necessary, and then sets up and executes one or more tasks that make the actual changes needed by the command.  (See also the documentation on \nCollections\n, which allow you to combine groups of tasks which can provide rollback functions to recover from failure situations.)\n\n\nFor details on how to add custom tasks to Robo, see the \nextending\n document.\n\n\nShortcuts\n\n\nSome tasks may have shortcuts. If a task does not require multi-step configuration, it can be executed with a single line:\n\n\n?php\n$this-\n_exec('ps aux');\n$this-\n_copy('config/env.example.yml','config/env.yml');\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\nEach task must return an instance of \nRobo\\Result\n. A Robo Result contains the task instance, exit code, message, and any variable data that the task may wish to return.\n\n\nNote\n: A task may also return \nNULL\n or an array as a shortcut for a successful result. In this instance, Robo will convert the value into a \nRobo\\Result\n, and will apply the provided array values, if any, to the result's variable data. This practice is supported, but not recommended.\n\n\nThe \nrun\n method of \nCompileAssets\n class may look like this:\n\n\nreturn new Robo\\Result($this, $exitCode, \nAssets compiled\n);\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\nreturn Robo\\Result::success($this, \nAssets compiled\n);\nreturn Robo\\Result::error($this, \nFailed to compile assets\n);\n\n\n\n\nYou can use this results to check if execution was successful, either using the \nwasSuccessful()\n method, or via the \ninvoke\n shortcut. We will use the \nExec\n task in next example to illustrate this:\n\n\n?php\nclass RoboFile\n{\n    use Robo\\Task\\Base\\loadShortcuts;\n\n    function test()\n    {\n        $res1 = $this-\n_exec('phpunit tests/integration');\n        $res2 = $this-\n_exec('phpunit tests/unit');\n\n        // print message when tests passed\n        if ($res1-\nwasSuccessful() and $res2-\nwasSuccessful()) $this-\nsay(\nAll tests passed\n);\n    }\n}\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen making multi-step commands that call one task after another, it is best to use a collection to group the tasks together. The collection will handle error detection and rollback, and will return a single Result object when done. For more information, see the \nCollections\n documentation.\n\n\nSome tasks may also attach data to the Result object.  If this is done, the data may be accessed as an array; for example, \n$result['path'];\n. This is not common.\n\n\nCommands should return a Result object obtained from a task; this will ensure that the command exit code is set correctly.  If a command does not have a Result object available, then it may use a ResultData object.  ResultData objects are just like Result objects, except the do not contain a reference to a task.\n\n\nreturn new Robo\\ResultData($exitcode, 'Error message.');\n\n\n\n\nIf the command returns a TaskInterface instead of a result, then the task will be executed, and the result from that task will be used as the final result of the command. See also \nFormatters\n, below.\n\n\nStack\n\n\nSome tasks contain \nStack\n in their name. These are called \"stack\" tasks, and they execute similar tasks one after the other.  Each of the primary methods in a stack class executes an operation.\n\n\nStack tasks also contain a \nstopOnFail\n method which can be used to stop task execution if one of its commands was unsuccessful.\n\n\nGlobal StopOnFail\n\n\nThere is a global \nstopOnFail\n method as well, that can be used to stop a command on first failure of a task.\n\n\n$this-\nstopOnFail(true);\n\n\n\n\nProgress\n\n\nRobo supports progress indicators via the Symfony ProgressBar class.  Long-running tasks that wish to display the progress indicator may do so via four simple steps:\n\n\n\n\nOverride the \nprogressIndicatorSteps()\n method and return the number of \"steps\" in the operation.\n\n\nCall \n$this-\nstartProgressIndicator()\n to begin the progress indicator running.\n\n\nCall \n$this-\nadvanceProgressIndicator()\n a number of times equal to the result returned by \nprogressIndicatorSteps()\n\n\nCall \n$this-\nstopProgressIndicator()\n when the operation is completed.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of this is shown below:\n\n\n?php\nclass MyTask extends BaseTask\n{\n    protected $steps = 10;\n\n    public function progressIndicatorSteps()\n    {\n        return $this-\nsteps;\n    }\n\n    public function run()\n    {\n        $exitCode = 0;\n        $errorMessage = \n;\n\n        $this-\nstartProgressIndicator();\n        for ($i = 0; $i \n $this-\nsteps; ++$i) {\n            $this-\nadvanceProgressIndicator();\n        }\n        $this-\nstopProgressIndicator();\n\n        return new Result($this, $exitCode, $errorMessage, ['time' =\n $this-\ngetExecutionTime()]);\n    }\n}\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nTasks should not attempt to use a specific progress indicator (e.g. the Symfony ProgressBar class) directly, as the ProgressIndicatorAwareTrait allows for an appropriate progress indicator to be used (or omitted) as best suits the application.\n\n\nNote that when using \nCollections\n, the progress bar will automatically be shown if the collection takes longer than two seconds to run.  Each task in the collection will count for one \"step\"; if the task supports progress indicators as shown above, then it will add an additional number of steps as indicated by its \nprogressIndicatorSteps()\n method.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nOn startup, Robo will load a configuration file, \nrobo.yml\n, if it exists in the current working directory, or in the directory $HOME/.robo/robo.yml, or at the path set by the \nROBO_CONFIG\n environment variable. If both the user's \nrobo.yml\n file and a \nrobo.yml\n in the current working directory exist, then both will be loaded, with values from the configuration file in the current working directory taking precedence over the values in the user's configuration file.\n\n\nEnvironment variables can also be used to set individual configuration values. The environment variable key should start with the string \nROBO_\n, and should be followed by an all-uppercase version of the configuration key, with spaces, dashes and dots converted to underscores. For example, to set the progress bar delay to 999999 seconds:\n\n\nexport ROBO_OPTIONS_PROGRESS_DELAY=999999\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration values may also be set via the \n-D\n commandline switch. The above effect can also be achieved by adding \n-Doptions.progress-delay=999999\n to any Robo command.\n\n\nConfiguration for Command Options\n\n\nThe preferred method for commands to use to read configuration is to simply define commandline options for each configuration value. Configuration may be provided for any command option in the \nrobo.yml\n configuration file.\n\n\nFor example, given the following Robo command:\n\n\n?php\n    function hello($opts = ['who' =\n 'unknown'])\n    {\n        $this-\nsay(\nHello, \n . $opts['who']);\n    }\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nwho\n option can be defined as follows:\n\n\ncommand:\n  hello:\n    options:\n      who: world\n\n\n\n\nIf you run this command, then it will print \nHello, world\n. If the \n--who\n option is provided on the command line, that value will take precidence over the value stored in configuration. Thus, \nhello --who=everyone\n will print \nHello, everyone\n.\n\n\nCommand groups may also share configuration options. For example, if you have commands \nfoo:bar\n, \nfoo:baz\n and \nfoo:boz\n, all of which share a common option \ncolor\n, then the following configuration will provide the value \nblue\n to \nfoo:bar\n and \nfoo:baz\n, and the value \ngreen\n to \nfoo:boz\n:\n\n\ncommand:\n  foo:\n    options:\n      color: blue\n    boz:\n      options:\n        color: green\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration for Task Settings\n\n\nRobo will automatically configure tasks with values from configuration. For example, given the following task definition:\n\n\n$this-\ntaskMyOperation()\n  -\ndir($buildDir)\n  -\nextrapolated(false)\n  -\nrun();\n\n\n\n\nYou could instead remove the setter methods and move the parameter values to a configruation file:\n\n\n$this-\ntaskComposerInstall()\n  -\nrun();\n\n\n\n\nThen, presuming that \ntaskMyOperation\n was implemented in a class \n\\MyOrg\\Task\\TaskGroup\\MyOperation\n, then the corresponding configuration file would appear as follows:\n\n\ntask:\n  TaskGroup:\n    MyOperation:\n      settings:\n        dir: /my/path\n        extrapolated: false\n\n\n\n\nThe key for configuration-injected settings is \ntask.PARTIAL_NAMESPACE.CLASSNAME.settings.key\n. PARTIAL_NAMESPACE is the namespace for the class, with each \n\\\n replaced with a \n.\n, and with each component of the namespace up to and including \nTask\n removed.\n\n\nTasks in the same namespace may also share configuration-injected settings. For example, the configuration below will set the \ndir\n option of any task implemented by a class in the \n*\\TaskGroup\\MyOperation\n namespace, unless the task has a more specific configuration value stored with its classname:\n\n\ntask:\n  TaskGroup:\n    settings:\n      dir: /my/path\n      extrapolated: false\n\n\n\n\nAccessing Configuration Directly\n\n\nIn a RoboFile, use \n\\Robo\\Robo::Config()-\nget('task.TaskGroup.MyOperation.settings.dir');\n to fetch the \ndir\n configuration option from the previous example.\n\n\nIn the implementation of \ntaskMyOperation()\n itself, it is in general not necessary to access configuration values directly, as it is preferable to allow Robo to inject configuration as described above. However, if desired, configuration may be accessed from within the method of any task that extends \n\\Robo\\Task\\BaseTask\n (or otherwise uses \nConfigAwareTrait\n) may do so via \nstatic::getConfigValue('key', 'default');\n.\n\n\nProviding Default Configuration in Code\n\n\nRoboFiles that wish to provide default configuration values that can be overridden via robo.yml values or commandline options may do so in the class' constructor method.  The example below demonstrates how to set up a default value for the \ntask.Ssh.remoteDir\n configuration property in code:\n\n\nclass RoboFile\n{\n    public function __construct()\n    {    \n        Robo\\Task\\Remote\\Ssh::configure('remoteDir', '/srv/www');\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf \ntask.Remote.Ssh.remoteDir\n is set to some other value in the robo.yml configuration file in the current directory, then the value from the configuration file will take precedence.\n\n\nLoading Configuration From Another Source\n\n\nSometimes, a RoboFile might want to define its own private configuration file to use in addition to the standard \nrobo.yml\n file. This can also be done in the constructor.\n\n\nclass RoboFile\n{\n    public function __construct()\n    {    \n        Robo::loadConfiguration([__DIR__ . '/myconf.yml']);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nNote that configuration loaded in this way will take precedence over the configuration loaded by default by Robo.\n\n\nIt is possible to have even more control than this if you \ncreate your own application using Robo as a Framework\n.\n\n\nIO\n\n\nAs you noticed, you can print text via the \nsay\n method, which is taken from the \nRobo\\Output\n trait.\n\n\n$this-\nsay(\nHello\n);\n\n\n\n\nAlso, you can ask for input from console:\n\n\n$name = $this-\nask(\nWhat is your name?\n);\n\n\n\n\nThere are also \naskDefault\n, \naskHidden\n, and \nconfirm\n methods.\n\n\nIn addition, Robo makes all of the methods of Symfony Style available through the \nio()\n method:\n\n\n$this-\nio()-\ntitle(\nBuild all site assets\n);\n\n\n\n\nThis allows Robo scripts to follow the documentation on \nHow to Style a Console Command\n if desired.\n\n\nFormatters\n\n\nIt is preferable for commands that look up and display information should avoid doing IO directly, and should instead return the data they wish to display as an array. This data can then be converted into different data formats, such as \"table\" and \"json\". The user may select which formatter to use via the --format option. For details on formatters, see the \nconsolidation/output-formatters\n project.\n\n\nWorking with Composer\n\n\nAdding a RoboFile to your Project\n\n\nRobo is designed to work well with Composer. To use Robo scripts in your Composer-based project, simply add \nrobo\n to your composer.json file:\n\n\n$ cd myproject\n$ composer require consolidation/Robo:~1\n$ ./vendor/bin/robo mycommand\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not want to type the whole path to Robo, you may add \n./vendor/bin\n to your \n$PATH\n (relative paths work), or use \ncomposer exec\n to find and run Robo:\n\n\n$ composer exec robo mycommand\n\n\n\n\nImplementing Composer Scripts with Robo\n\n\nWhen using Robo in your project, it is convenient to define Composer scripts that call your Robo commands.  Simply add the following to your composer.json file:\n\n\n{\n    \nname\n: \nmyorg/myproject\n,\n    \nrequire\n: {\n        \nconsolidation/Robo\n: \n~1\n\n    },\n    \nscripts\n: {\n        \ntest\n: \ncomposer robo test\n,\n        \nphar\n: \ncomposer robo phar:build\n,\n        \nrobo\n: \nrobo --ansi --load-from $(pwd)/scripts/BuildCommands.php\n\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: When you include Robo as a library like this, some external projects used by certain core Robo tasks are not automatically included in your project.  See the \n\"suggest\":\n section of Robo's composer.json for a list of external projects you might also want to require in your project.\n\n\nOnce you have set up your composer.json file (and ran \ncomposer update\n if you manually changed the \nrequire\n or \nrequire-dev\n sections), Composer will ensure that your project-local copy of Robo in the \nvendor/bin\n dir is in your \n$PATH\n when you run the additional Composer scripts that you declared:\n\n\n$ cd myproject\n$ composer test\n$ composer phar\n\n\n\n\nThis will call the public methods \ntest()\n and \nphar()\n in your RoboFile.php when using \ncomposer test\n and \ncomposer phar\n, respectively.\n\n\nAdvertising your build commands as Composer scripts is a useful way to provide the key commands used for testing, building or packaging your application. Also, if your application should happen to provide a commandline tool to perform the operations of the application itself, then defining your build commands in their own RoboFile provides desirable separation, keeping your build commands out of the help and list commands of your primary script.\n\n\nIf you would like to simplify the output of your script (e.g. when running on a CI service), replace the \n--ansi\n option in the example above with \n--no-ansi\n, and  colored terminal output and progress bars will be disabled. \n\n\nRobo as a Framework\n\n\nFor an overview on how to turn your Robo scripts into standalone tools, see the example \nrobo.script\n, and the section \nRobo as a Framework\n.",

In this instance, Robo will convert the value into a  Robo\\Result , and will apply the provided array values, if any, to the result's variable data. This practice is supported, but not recommended.  The  run  method of  CompileAssets  class may look like this:  return new Robo\\Result($this, $exitCode,  Assets compiled );  or  return Robo\\Result::success($this,  Assets compiled );\nreturn Robo\\Result::error($this,  Failed to compile assets );  You can use this results to check if execution was successful, either using the  wasSuccessful()  method, or via the  invoke  shortcut.

When making multi-step commands that call one task after another, it is best to use a collection to group the tasks together.

Some tasks may also attach data to the Result object.  If this is done, the data may be accessed as an array; for example,  $result['path']; . This is not common.  Commands should return a Result object obtained from a task; this will ensure that the command exit code is set correctly.  If a command does not have a Result object available, then it may use a ResultData object.  ResultData objects are just like Result objects, except the do not contain a reference to a task.  return new Robo\\ResultData($exitcode, 'Error message.');  If the command returns a TaskInterface instead of a result, then the task will be executed, and the result from that task will be used as the final result of the command.

Call  $this- advanceProgressIndicator()  a number of times equal to the result returned by  progressIndicatorSteps()  Call  $this- stopProgressIndicator()  when the operation is completed.

Tasks should not attempt to use a specific progress indicator (e.g. the Symfony ProgressBar class) directly, as the ProgressIndicatorAwareTrait allows for an appropriate progress indicator to be used (or omitted) as best suits the application.  Note that when using  Collections , the progress bar will automatically be shown if the collection takes longer than two seconds to run.

All of the tasks created by the same builder are added to a collection; when the \nrun()\n method is called, all of the tasks in the collection run. \n\n\nThe 'publish' command from Robo's own RoboFile is shown below.  It uses a collection builder to run some git and filesystem operations. The \"completion\" tasks are run after all other tasks complete, or during rollback processing when an operation fails.\n\n\n?php\nclass RoboFile extends \\Robo\\Tasks\n{\n    public function publish()\n    {\n        $current_branch = exec('git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD');\n\n        $collection = $this-\ncollectionBuilder();\n        $collection-\ntaskGitStack()\n            -\ncheckout('site')\n            -\nmerge('master')\n        -\ncompletion($this-\ntaskGitStack()-\ncheckout($current_branch))\n        -\ntaskFilesystemStack()\n            -\ncopy('CHANGELOG.md', 'docs/changelog.md')\n        -\ncompletion($this-\ntaskFilesystemStack()-\nremove('docs/changelog.md'))\n        -\ntaskExec('mkdocs gh-deploy');\n\n        return $collection;\n    }\n}\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe example above also adds a couple of tasks as \"completions\"; these are run when the collection completes execution, as explained below.\n\n\nRollbacks and Completions\n\n\nRobo also provides rollbacks and completions, special tasks that are eligible to run only if all of the tasks added to the collection before them succeed. The section below explains the circumstances under which these tasks will run.\n\n\nCompletion Tasks\n\n\nCompletions run whenever their collection completes or fails, but only if all of the tasks that come before it succeed. An example of this is shown in the first example above. A filesystem stack task copies CHANDELOG.md to docs/changelog.md; after this task is added to the collection, another filesystem stack task is added as a completion to delete docs/changelog.md. This is done because docs/changelog.md is only intended to exist long enough to be used by the \nmkdocs\n task, which is added later. \n\n\nRollback Tasks\n\n\nIn addition to completions, Robo also supports rollbacks. Rollback tasks can be used to clean up after failures, so the state of the system does not change when execution is interrupted by an error. A rollback task is executed if all of the tasks that come before it succeed, and at least one of the tasks that come after it fails.  If all tasks succeed, then no rollback tasks are executed.\n\n\nRollback and Completion Methods\n\n\nAny task may also implement \\Robo\\Contract\\RollbackInterface; if this is done, then its \nrollback()\n method will be called if the task is \nrun()\n on a collection that later fails.\n\n\nUse \naddAsCompletion($collection)\n in place of \naddAsRollback($collection)\n, or implement \\Robo\\Contract\\CompletionInterface. Completions otherwise work exactly like rollbacks.\n\n\nBy default, rollbacks and completions tasks or callbacks continue even if errors occur. If you would like to explicitly cancel or abort the rollback or completion, you may throw the \n\\Robo\\Exception\\AbortTasksException\n exception.\n\n\nRollback and Completion Callbacks\n\n\nYou may also provide arbitrary methods as \ncallable\ns to serve as rollback or completion functions, as shown below:\n\n\n?php\n  $collection-\nrollbackCode([$myobject, 'myrollback']);\n  $collection-\ncompletionCode([$myobject, 'mycompletion']);\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporary Objects\n\n\nSince the concept of temporary objects that are cleaned up  on failure is a common pattern, Robo provides built-in support for them. Temporary directories and files are provided out of the box; other kinds of temporary objects can be easily created using the Temporary global collection.\n\n\nTemporary Directories\n\n\nIt is recommended that operations that perform multiple filesystem operations should, whenever possible, do most of their work in a temporary directory. Temporary directories are created by \n$this-\ntaskTmpDir()\n, and are automatically removed when the collection completes or rolls back. As an added convenience, the CollectionBuilder class has a \ntmpDir()\n method that creates a temporary directory via \ntaskTmpDir()\n, and then returns the path to the temporary directory.\n\n\n?php\nclass RoboFile extends \\Robo\\Tasks\n{\n    function myOperation()\n    {\n        $collection = $this-\ncollectionBuilder();\n\n        // Create a temporary directory, and fetch its path.\n        $work = $collection-\ntmpDir();\n\n        $collection\n          -\ntaskWriteToFile(\n$work/README.md\n)\n            -\nline('-----')\n            -\nline(date('Y-m-d').' Generated file: do not edit.')\n            -\nline('----');\n\n        // If all of the preceding tasks succeed, then rename the temporary \n        // directory to its final name.\n        $collection-\ntaskFilesystemStack()\n          -\nrename($work, 'destination');\n\n        return $collection-\nrun();\n    }\n}\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the previous example, the path to the temporary directory is stored in the variable \n$work\n, and is passed as needed to the parameters of the other tasks as they are added to the collection. After the task collection is run, the temporary directory will be automatically deleted. In the example above, the temporary directory is renamed by the last task in the collection. This allows the working directory to persist; the collection will still attempt to remove the working directory, but no errors will be thrown if it no longer exists in its original location. Following this pattern allows Robo scripts to easily and safely do work that cleans up after itself on failure, without introducing a lot of branching or additional error recovery code.  This paradigm is common enough to warrant a shortcut method of accomplishing the same thing.  The example below is identical to the one above, save for the fact that it uses the \nworkDir()\n method instead of \ntmpDir()\n.  \nworkDir()\n renames the temporary directory to its final name if the collection completes; any directory that exists in the same location will be overwritten at that time, but will persist if the collection roles back.\n\n\n?php\nclass RoboFile extends \\Robo\\Tasks\n{\n    function myOperation()\n    {\n        $collection = $this-\ncollectionBuilder();\n\n        // Create a temporary directory, and fetch its path.\n        // If all of the tasks succeed, then rename the temporary directory\n        // to its final name.\n        $work = $collection-\nworkDir('destination');\n\n        $collection\n          -\ntaskWriteToFile(\n$work/README.md\n)\n            -\nline('-----')\n            -\nline(date('Y-m-d').' Generated file: do not edit.')\n            -\nline('----');\n\n        return $collection-\nrun();\n    }\n}\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporary directories may also be created via the shortcut \n$this-\n_tmpDir();\n. Temporary directories created in this way are deleted when the script terminates.\n\n\nTemporary Files\n\n\nRobo also provides an API for creating temporary files. They may be created via \n$this-\ntaskTmpFile()\n; they are used exactly like \n$this-\ntaskWrite()\n, except they are given a random name on creation, and are deleted when their collection completes.  If they are not added to a collection, then they are deleted when the script terminates.\n\n\nThe Temporary Global Collection\n\n\nRobo maintains a special collection called the Temporary global collection. This collection is used to keep track of temporary objects that are not part of any collection. For example, Robo temporary directories and temporary files are managed by the Temporary global collection. These temporary objects are cleaned up automatically when the script terminates.\n\n\nIt is easy to create your own temporary tasks that behave in the same way as the provided temporary directory and temporary file tasks. There are two steps required:\n\n\n\n\nImplement \\Robo\\Contract\\CompletionInterface\n\n\nWrap the task via Temporary::wrap()\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the implementation of taskTmpFile() looks like this:\n\n\n?php\n    protected function taskTmpFile($filename = 'tmp', $extension = '', $baseDir = '', $includeRandomPart = true)\n    {\n        return Temporary::wrap(new TmpFile($filename, $extension, $baseDir, $includeRandomPart));\n    }\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \ncomplete()\n method of the task will be called once the Collection the temporary object is attached to finishes running. If the temporary is not added to a collection, then its \ncomplete()\n method will be called when the script terminates.\n\n\nChained State\n\n\nWhen using a collection builder, it is possible to pass state from one task to another. State is generated during the \nrun()\n method of each task, and returned in a \nRobo\\Result\n object. Each result has a \"message\" and a key/value data store that contains the task's state. This state can be made available to later tasks in the builder.\n\n\nImplicitly Passing State\n\n\nSometimes it may be desirable to process the files produced by one task using a following task that alters the result.\n\n\nFor example, if you have one task that takes a set of source files and generates destination files, and another task that encrypts a set of files, you could encrypt the results from the first task by running both of the tasks independently:\n\n\n?php\n    $result = $this-\ntaskGenerate()\n        -\nfiles($sources)\n        -\nrun();\n\n    $result = $this-\ntaskEncrypt()\n        -\nfiles($result['files'])\n        -\nrun();\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Encrypt task implements \n\\Robo\\State\\Consumer\n and accepts 'files' from the current state, then these tasks may be chained together as follows:\n\n\n?php\n    $collection = $this-\ncollectionBuilder();\n    $collection\n        -\ntaskGenerate()\n            -\nfiles($sources)\n        -\ntaskEncrypt()\n        -\nrun();\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nTasks that do not implement the \nConsumer\n interface may still be chained together by explicitly connecting the state from one task with the task configuration methods, as explained in the following section:\n\n\nExplicitly Passing State\n\n\nState from the key/value data store, if set, is automatically stored in the collection's state. The \nstoreState()\n method can be used to store the result \"message\".\n\n\nTo pass state from one task to another, the \ndeferTaskConfiguration()\n method may be used. This method defers initialization until immediately before the task's \nrun()\n method is called. It then calls a single named setter method, passing it the value of some state variable. \n\n\nFor example, the builder below will create a new directory named after the output of the \nuname -n\n command returned by taskExec. Note that it is necessary to call \nprintOutput(false)\n in order to make the output of taskExec available to the state system.\n\n\n?php\n    $this-\ncollectionBuilder()\n        -\ntaskExec('uname -n')\n            -\nprintOutput(false)\n            -\nstoreState('system-name')\n        -\ntaskFilesystemStack()\n            -\ndeferTaskConfiguration('mkdir', 'system-name')\n        -\nrun();\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nMore complex task configuration may be done via the \ndefer()\n method. \ndefer()\n works like \ndeferTaskConfiguration()\n, except that it will run an arbitrary \ncallable\n immediately prior to the execution of the task. The example below works exactly the same as the previous example, but is implemented using \ndefer()\n instead of \ndeferTaskConfiguration()\n.\n\n\n?php\n    $this-\ncollectionBuilder()\n        -\ntaskExec('uname -n')\n            -\nprintOutput(false)\n            -\nstoreState('system-name')\n        -\ntaskFilesystemStack()\n            -\ndefer(\n                function ($task, $state) {\n                    $task-\nmkdir($state['system-name']);\n                }\n            )\n        -\nrun();\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, it is preferable to collect all of the information needed first, and then use that data to configure the necessary tasks. For example, the previous example could be implemented more simply by calling \n$system_name = exec('uname -n');\n and \ntaskFilesystemStack-\nmkdir($system_name);\n. Chained state can be helpful in instances where there is a more complex relationship between the tasks.\n\n\nNamed Tasks\n\n\nIt is also possible to provide names for the tasks added to a collection. This has two primary benefits:\n\n\n\n\nAny result data returned from a named task is stored in the Result object under the task name.\n\n\nIt is possible for other code to add more tasks before or after any named task.\n\n\n\n\nThis feature is useful if you have functions that create task collections, and return them as a function results. The original caller can then use the \n$collection-\nbefore()\n or \n$collection-\nafter()\n to insert sequenced tasks into the set of operations to be performed. One reason this might be done would be to define a base set of operations to perform (e.g. in a deploy), and then apply modifications for other environments (e.g. dev or stage).\n\n\n?php\n  $collection-\naddCode(\n    function() use ($work)\n    {\n      // do something with $work      \n    },\n    \ntaskname\n);\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven a collection with named tasks, it is possible to insert more tasks before or after a task of a given name.\n\n\n?php\n  $collection-\nafter(\ntaskname\n,\n    function() use ($work)\n    {\n      // do something with $work after \ntaskname\n executes, if it succeeds.    \n    });\n?\n\n\n\n\n\n?php\n  $collection-\nbefore(\ntaskname\n,\n    function() use ($work)\n    {\n      // do something with $work before \ntaskname\n executes.    \n    });\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is recommended that named tasks be avoided unless specifically needed.",

To pass state from one task to another, the  deferTaskConfiguration()  method may be used. This method defers initialization until immediately before the task's  run()  method is called. It then calls a single named setter method, passing it the value of some state variable.   For example, the builder below will create a new directory named after the output of the  uname -n  command returned by taskExec. Note that it is necessary to call  printOutput(false)  in order to make the output of taskExec available to the state system.  ?php\n    $this- collectionBuilder()\n        - taskExec('uname -n')\n            - printOutput(false)\n            - storeState('system-name')\n        - taskFilesystemStack()\n            - deferTaskConfiguration('mkdir', 'system-name')\n        - run();\n?   More complex task configuration may be done via the  defer()  method.  defer()  works like  deferTaskConfiguration() , except that it will run an arbitrary  callable  immediately prior to the execution of the task. The example below works exactly the same as the previous example, but is implemented using  defer()  instead of  deferTaskConfiguration() .  ?php\n    $this- collectionBuilder()\n        - taskExec('uname -n')\n            - printOutput(false)\n            - storeState('system-name')\n        - taskFilesystemStack()\n            - defer(\n                function ($task, $state) {\n                    $task- mkdir($state['system-name']);\n                }\n            )\n        - run();\n?   In general, it is preferable to collect all of the information needed first, and then use that data to configure the necessary tasks. For example, the previous example could be implemented more simply by calling  $system_name = exec('uname -n');  and  taskFilesystemStack- mkdir($system_name); . Chained state can be helpful in instances where there is a more complex relationship between the tasks.",

To find existing Robo task extensions, search in Packagist for projects of type \nrobo-tasks\n.\n\n\nThe convention used to add new tasks for use in your RoboFiles is to create a wrapper trait named \nTasks\n in your namespace that instantiates the implementation class for each task. Each task method in the trait should start with the prefix \ntask\n, and should use \nchained method calls\n for configuration. Task execution should be triggered by the method \nrun\n.\n\n\nTo include additional tasks in your RoboFile, you must \nuse\n the appropriate \nTasks\n in your RoboFile. See the section \nIncluding Additional Tasks\n below. To create your own Robo extension that provides tasks for use in RoboFiles, then you must write your own class that implements TaskInterface, and create a \nTasks\n trait for it as described in the section \nCreating a Robo Extension\n.\n\n\nNote: The \nTasks\n traits are called \nloadTasks\n in Robo core. This is a legacy name, preserved for backwards compatibility purposes. These traits will all be renamed to \nTasks\n in Robo 2.0.\n\n\nIncluding Additional Tasks\n\n\nAdditional tasks may be installed into projects that have included Robo via Composer. For example:\n\n\n$ cd myproject\n$ composer require boedah/robo-drush\n\n\n\n\nIf any of the tasks you include require external Composer projects themselves, then you must \ncomposer require\n these as well.  See the \nsuggests\n section of Robo's composer.json file for a list of some projects you might need to require.\n\n\nOnce the extension you wish to use has been added to your vendor directory, you may then include it from your RoboFile:\n\n\nclass RoboFile extends \\Robo\\Tasks\n{\n  use \\Boedah\\Robo\\Task\\Drush\\Tasks;\n\n  public function test()\n  {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have done this, all of the tasks defined in the extension you selected will be available for use in your commands.\n\n\nNote that at the moment, it is not possible to extend Robo when using the robo.phar. This capability may be added in the future via \nembedded composer\n.\n\n\nRegister command files via PSR-4 autoloading\n\n\nYou can have your project expose extra Robo command files by providing them within your project's PSR-4 namespace.\n\n\nFor example, given the following PSR-4 namespace in your \ncomposer.json\n:\n\n\n{\n    \nautoload\n: {\n        \npsr-4\n: {\n            \nMyProject\\\\\n: \n./src/\n\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nExtra command files can be exposed by creating one or more classes under \n./src/Robo/Plugin/Commands\n, as shown in the\nexample below:\n\n\n?php\n\nnamespace MyProject\\Robo\\Plugin\\Commands;\n\nclass MyCustomCommands extends \\Robo\\Tasks\n{\n    /**\n     * @command my-project:command-one\n     */\n    public function commandOne() { }\n\n    /**\n     * @command my-project:command-two\n     */\n    public function commandTwo() { }\n}\n\n\n\n\nPlease note: command files classes must be placed under \nRobo/Plugin/Commands\n relative namespace and their name\nmust end in \nCommand.php\n or \nCommands.php\n.\n\n\nYou can now access your new commands via Robo:\n\n\n$ ./vendor/bin/robo\n$ ./robo\nRobo 1.2.2-dev\n\nUsage:\n  command [options] [arguments]\n...\n\nAvailable commands:\n  help                  Displays help for a command\n  list                  Lists commands\n my-project\n  my-project:command-one\n  my-project:command-two\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Robo Extension\n\n\nA Robo tasks extension is created by advertising a Composer package of type \nrobo-tasks\n on \nPackagist\n.  For an overview on how this is done, see the article \nCreating your very own Composer Package\n.  Specific instructions for creating Robo task extensions are provided below.\n\n\nCreate your composer.json File\n\n\nYour composer.json file should look something like the example below:\n\n\n{\n    \nname\n: \nboedah/robo-drush\n,\n    \ndescription\n: \nDrush CommandStack for Robo Task Runner\n,\n    \ntype\n: \nrobo-tasks\n,\n    \nautoload\n: {\n        \npsr-4\n: {\n            \nBoedah\\\\Robo\\\\Task\\\\Drush\\\\\n: \nsrc\n\n        }\n    },\n    \nrequire\n: {\n        \nphp\n: \n=5.5.0\n,\n        \nconsolidation/robo\n: \n~1\n\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nCustomize the name and autoload paths as necessary, and add any additional required projects needed by the tasks that your extensions will provide.  The type of your project should always be \nrobo-tasks\n.  Robo only supports php \n= 5.5.0; you may require a higher version of php if necessary.\n\n\nCreate the Tasks.php Trait\n\n\nIt is recommended to place your trait-loading task in a \nTasks\n file in the same namespace as the task implementation.\n\n\nnamespace Boedah\\Robo\\Task\\Drush;\n\ntrait Tasks\n{\n    /**\n     * @param string $pathToDrush\n     * @return DrushStack\n     */\n    protected function taskDrushStack($pathToDrush = 'drush')\n    {\n        return $this-\ntask(__FUNCTION__, $pathToDrush);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nNote that the name of the service for a given task must start with the word \"task\", and must have the same name as the function used to call the task.  \n$this-\ntask()\n looks up the service by name; using the PHP built-in constant \nFUNCTION\n for this parameter ensures that the names of these items remain in alignment.\n\n\nTask implementation\n\n\nThe implementation of each task class should extend \\Robo\\Task\\BaseTask, or some class that extends the same, and should used chained initializer methods and defer all operations that alter the state of the system until its \nrun()\n method.  If you follow these patterns, then your task extensions will be usable via Robo collection builders, as explained in the \ncollections\n documentation.\n\n\nThere are many examples of task implementations in the Robo\\Task namespace.  A very basic task example is provided below.  The namespace is \nMyAssetTasks\n, and the example task is \nCompileAssets\n. To customize to your purposes, choose an appropriate namespace, and then define as many tasks as you need.\n\n\n?php\nnamespace MyAssetTasks;\n\ntrait Tasks\n{\n    /**\n     * Example task to compile assets\n     *\n     * @param string $pathToCompileAssets\n     * @return \\MyAssetTasks\\CompileAssets\n     */\n    protected function taskCompileAssets($path = null)\n    {\n        // Always construct your tasks with the `task()` task builder.\n        return $this-\ntask(CompileAssets::class, $path);\n    }\n}\n\nclass CompileAssets implements \\Robo\\Contract\\TaskInterface\n{\n    // configuration params\n    protected $path;\n    protected $to;\n    function __construct($path)\n    {\n        $this-\npath = $path;\n    }\n\n    function to($filename)\n    {\n        $this-\nto = $filename;\n        // must return $this\n        return $this;\n    }\n\n    // must implement Run\n    function run()\n    {\n        //....\n    }\n}\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use the tasks you define in a RoboFile, use its \nTasks\n trait as explained in the section \nIncluding Additional Tasks\n, above.\n\n\nTaskIO\n\n\nTo allow tasks access IO, use the \nRobo\\Common\\TaskIO\n trait, or inherit your task class from \nRobo\\Task\\BaseTask\n (recommended).\n\n\nInside tasks you should print process details with \nprintTaskInfo\n, \nprintTaskSuccess\n, and \nprintTaskError\n.\n\n\n$this-\nprintTaskInfo('Processing...');\n\n\n\n\nThe Task IO methods send all output through a PSR-3 logger. Tasks should use task IO exclusively; methods such as 'say' and 'ask' should reside in the command method. This allows tasks to be usable in any context that has a PSR-3 logger, including background or server processes where it is not possible to directly query the user.\n\n\nTasks That Use Tasks\n\n\nIf one task implementation needs to use other tasks while it is running, it should do so via a \nCollectionBuilder\n object, as explained in the \nCollections\n documentation.\n\n\nTo obtain access to a \nCollectionBuilder\n, a task should implement \nBuilderAwareInterface\n and use \nBuilderAwareTrait\n.  It will then have access to a collection builder via the \n$this-\ncollectionBuilder()\n method.\n\n\nTesting Extensions\n\n\nIf you wish to use the \ntask()\n methods from your \nTasks\n trait in your unit tests, it is necessary to also use the Robo \nTaskAccessor\n trait, and define a \ncollectionBuilder()\n method to provide a builder.  Collection builders are used to initialize all Robo tasks.  The easiest way to get a usable collection builder in your tests is to initialize Robo's default dependency injection container, and use it to request a new builder.\n\n\nAn example of how to do this in a PHPUnit test is shown below.\n\n\nuse League\\Container\\ContainerAwareInterface;\nuse League\\Container\\ContainerAwareTrait;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Output\\NullOutput;\nuse Robo\\TaskAccessor;\nuse Robo\\Robo;\nuse Robo\\Collection\\CollectionBuilder;\n\nclass DrushStackTest extends \\PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase implements ContainerAwareInterface\n{\n    use \\Boedah\\Robo\\Task\\Drush\\Tasks;\n    use TaskAccessor;\n    use ContainerAwareTrait;\n\n    // Set up the Robo container so that we can create tasks in our tests.\n    function setup()\n    {\n        $container = Robo::createDefaultContainer(null, new NullOutput());\n        $this-\nsetContainer($container);\n    }\n\n    // Scaffold the collection builder\n    public function collectionBuilder()\n    {\n        $emptyRobofile = new \\Robo\\Tasks;\n        return CollectionBuilder::create($this-\ngetContainer(), $emptyRobofile);\n    }\n\n    public function testYesIsAssumed()\n    {\n        $command = $this-\ntaskDrushStack()\n            -\ndrush('command')\n            -\ngetCommand();\n        $this-\nassertEquals('drush command -y', $command);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nTo assert that the output of a command contains some value, use a \nSymfony\\Component\\Console\\Output\\BufferedOutput\n in place of null output when calling Robo::createDefaultContainer().",

            "text": "Robo as a Framework\n\n\nFor a faster and better start to creating your own commandline application, please see the documentation in the \ng1a/starter\n project.\n\n\nThere are multiple ways to use and package Robo scripts; a few of the alternatives are presented below.\n\n\nCreating a Standalone Phar with Robo\n\n\nIt is possible to create a standalone phar that is implemented with Robo; doing this does not require the RoboFile to be located in the current working directory, or any particular location within your project. To achieve this, first set up your project as shown in the section \nImplementing Composer Scripts with Robo\n. Use of the \"scripts\" section is optional.\n\n\nNext, add an \"autoload\" section to your composer.json to provide a namespace for your Robo commands:\n\n\n{\n    \nname\n: \nmyorg/myproject\n,\n    \nrequire\n: {\n        \nconsolidation/Robo\n: \n^1\n\n    },\n    \nautoload\n:{\n        \npsr-4\n:{\n            \nMyProject\\\\\n:\nsrc\n\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new file for your Robo commands, e.g. \nclass RoboFile\n in \nnamespace MyProject\\Commands;\n in the file \nsrc\\Commands\\RoboFile.php\n.  Optionally, add more task libraries as described in the \nextending\n document.\n\n\nCreate a startup script similar to the one below, and add it to the root of your project, or some other location of your choosing:\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env php\n\n?php\n\n// If we're running from phar load the phar autoload file.\n$pharPath = \\Phar::running(true);\nif ($pharPath) {\n    $autoloaderPath = \n$pharPath/vendor/autoload.php\n;\n} else {\n    if (file_exists(__DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php')) {\n        $autoloaderPath = __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';\n    } elseif (file_exists(__DIR__.'/../../autoload.php')) {\n        $autoloaderPath = __DIR__ . '/../../autoload.php';\n    } else {\n        die(\nCould not find autoloader. Run 'composer install'.\n);\n    }\n}\n$classLoader = require $autoloaderPath;\n\n// Customization variables\n$appName = \nMyAppName\n;\n$appVersion = trim(file_get_contents(__DIR__ . '/VERSION'));\n$commandClasses = [ \\MyProject\\Commands\\RoboFile::class ];\n$selfUpdateRepository = 'myorg/myproject';\n$configurationFilename = 'myconfig.yml';\n\n// Define our Runner, and pass it the command classes we provide.\n$runner = new \\Robo\\Runner($commandClasses);\n$runner\n  -\nsetSelfUpdateRepository($selfUpdateRepository)\n  -\nsetConfigurationFilename($configurationFilename)\n  -\nsetClassLoader($classLoader);\n\n// Execute the command and return the result.\n$output = new \\Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Output\\ConsoleOutput();\n$statusCode = $runner-\nexecute($argv, $appName, $appVersion, $output);\nexit($statusCode);\n\n\n\n\nWhen using Robo as a framework, the Robo file should be included in the autoloader, as Robo does not include a \nRoboFile.php\n file when used in this mode. Instead, specify the class or classes to load as a parameter to the Robo\\Runner constructor.\n\n\nUse \nbox-project/box2\n or Robo's taskPackPhar to create a phar for your application. If your application's repository is hosted on GitHub, then passing the appropriate GitHub \norg/project\n to the \n\\Robo\\Robo::run()\n method, as shown above, will enable the \nself:update\n command to automatically update to the latest available version. Note that \nself:update\n only works with phar distributions.\n\n\nUsing Multiple RoboFiles in a Standalone Application\n\n\nIt is possible to provide as many command classes as you wish to the Robo \nRunner()\n constructor. You might wish to separate your Robo command implementations into separate Robo files if you have a lot of commands, or if you wish to group similar commands together in the same source file. If you do this, you can simply add more class references to the \n$commandClasses\n variable shown above.\n\n\n$commandClasses = [ \n    \\MyProject\\Commands\\BuildCommands::class, \n    \\MyProject\\Commands\\DeployCommands::class \n];\n\n\n\n\nIf your application has a large number of command files, or if it supports command extensions, then you might wish to use the Command Discovery class to locate your files. The \nCommandFileDiscovery\n class will use the Symfony Finder class to search for all filenames matching the provided search pattern. It will return a list of class names using the provided base namespace.\n\n\n$discovery = new \\Consolidation\\AnnotatedCommand\\CommandFileDiscovery();\n$discovery-\nsetSearchPattern('*Command.php');\n$commandClasses = $discovery-\ndiscover('php/MyProject/Commands', '\\MyProject\\Commands');\n\n\n\n\nPass the resulting \n$commandClasses\n to the \nRunner()\n constructor as shown above.  See the annotated-commands project for more information about the different options that the discovery command takes.\n\n\nUsing Your Own Dependency Injection Container with Robo (Advanced)\n\n\nIt is also possible to completely replace the Robo application with your own.  To do this, set up your project as described in the sections above, but replace the Robo runner with your own main event loop.\n\n\nAdd the following to your startup file:\n\n\n?php\nuse League\\Container\\Container;\nuse Robo\\Robo;\n\n$input = new \\Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\ArgvInput($argv);\n$output = new \\Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Output\\ConsoleOutput();\n$config = Robo::createConfiguration(['myconf.yml']);\n$app = new \\MyApplication($config, $input, $output);\n$status_code = $app-\nrun($input, $output);\nexit($status_code);\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, create your own custom application:\n\n\n?php\n\nuse Robo\\Common\\ConfigAwareTrait;\nuse Robo\\Config;\nuse Robo\\Robo;\nuse Robo\\Runner as RoboRunner;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Application;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\InputInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Output\\OutputInterface;\n\nclass MyApplication {\n\n  const APPLICATION_NAME = 'My Application';\n  const REPOSITORY = 'org/project';\n\n  use ConfigAwareTrait;\n\n  private $runner;\n\n  public function __construct(\n    Config $config,\n    InputInterface $input = NULL,\n    OutputInterface $output = NULL\n  ) {\n\n    // Create applicaton.\n    $this-\nsetConfig($config);\n    $application = new Application(self::APPLICATION_NAME, $config-\nget('version'));\n\n    // Create and configure container.\n    $container = Robo::createDefaultContainer($input, $output, $application,\n      $config);\n    $this-\nsetContainer($container);\n    $container-\nadd(MyCustomService::class);\n\n    // Instantiate Robo Runner.\n    $this-\nrunner = new RoboRunner([\n      My\\Custom\\Command::class\n    ]);\n    $this-\nrunner-\nsetContainer($container);\n    $this-\nrunner-\nsetSelfUpdateRepository(self::REPOSITORY);\n  }\n\n  public function run(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output) {\n    $status_code = $this-\nrunner-\nrun($input, $output);\n\n    return $status_code;\n  }\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using League\\Container (recommended), then you may simply add and share your own classes to the same container.  If you are using some other DI container, then you should use \ndelegate lookup\n to combine them.\n\n\nUsing a Custom Configuration Loader\n\n\nRobo provides a very simple configuration loader. If you wish to use more capable loader, you may opt to do so. Replace the call to \nRobo::createConfiguration()\n with code similar to the following:\n\n\nuse Robo\\Config\\Config;\nuse Consolidation\\Config\\Loader\\YamlConfigLoader;\nuse Consolidation\\Config\\Loader\\ConfigProcessor;\n\n$config = new Config();\n$loader = new YamlConfigLoader();\n$processor = new ConfigProcessor();\n$processor-\nextend($loader-\nload('defaults.yml'));\n$processor-\nextend($loader-\nload('myconf.yml'));\n$config-\nimport($processor-\nexport());\n\n\n\n\nYou may also wish to subclass the provided \nConfig\n and \nConfigProcessor\n classes to customize their behavior.\n\n\nThe example above presumes that the configuration object starts off empty. If you need to repeat this process to extend the configuration in a later stage, you should call \n$processor-\nadd($config-\nexport());\n to ensure that the configuration processor is seeded with the previous configuration values.\n\n\nAny configuraiton loader that produces a nested array may be used in place of the config loaders and config processor shown in the example above. For example, if you wish to find configuration files in a certain set of directories, allow .yml or .xml configuration files, and validate the schema of your configuration files (to alert users of any syntax errors or unrecognized configuration values), you might want to consider \nSymfony/Config\n. Symfony/Config produces a clean array of configuration values; the result of \n$processor-\nprocessConfiguration()\n may be provided directly to Robo's \n$config-\nimport()\n method.",

To use this feature, tasks must be given names via an optional \n$taskName\n parameter when they are added.\n\n\nCollections may be added to collections, if desired. \n\n\n[CollectionBuilder] Create tasks and add them to a collection in a single operation.\n\n\n$this-\ncollectionBuilder()-\ntaskExec('pwd')-\ntaskExec('ls')-\nrun()\n\n\nAdd output formatters\n\n\nIf a Robo command returns a string, or a \nResult\n object with a \n$message\n, then it will be printed\n\n\nCommands may be annotated to describe output formats that may be used\n\n\nStructured arrays returned from function results may be converted into different formats, such as a table, yml, json, etc.\n\n\nTasks must \nuse TaskIO\n for output methods. It is no longer possible to \nuse IO\n from a task. For direct access use \nRobo::output()\n (not recommended).   \n\n\nUse league/container to do Dependency Injection\n\n\nBreaking\n Tasks' loadTasks traits must use \n$this-\ntask(TaskClass::class);\n instead of \nnew TaskClass();\n\n\nBreaking\n Tasks that use other tasks must use \n$this-\ncollectionBuilder()-\ntaskName();\n instead of \nnew TaskClass();\n when creating task objects to call. Implement \nRobo\\Contract\\BuilderAwareInterface\n and use \nRobo\\Contract\\BuilderAwareTrait\n to add the \ncollectionBuilder()\n method to your task class.\n\n\nBreaking\n The \narg()\n, \nargs()\n and \noption()\n methods in CommandArguments now escape the values passed in to them. There is now a \nrawArg()\n method if you need to add just one argument that has already been escaped.\n\n\nBreaking\n taskWrite is now called taskWriteToFile\n\n\n[Extract] task added\n\n\n[Pack] task added\n\n\n[TmpDir], [WorkDir] and [TmpFile] tasks added\n\n\nSupport Robo scripts that allows scripts starting with \n#!/usr/bin/env robo\n to define multiple robo commands.  Use \n#!/usr/bin/env robo run\n to define a single robo command implemented by the \nrun()\n method.\n\n\nProvide ProgresIndicatorAwareInterface and ProgressIndicatorAwareTrait that make it easy to add progress indicators to tasks\n\n\nAdd --simulate mode that causes tasks to print what they would have done, but make no changes\n\n\nAdd \nrobo generate:task\n code-generator to make new stack-based task wrappers around existing classes\n\n\nAdd \nrobo sniff\n by @dustinleblanc. Runs the PHP code sniffer followed by the code beautifier, if needed.\n\n\nImplement ArrayInterface for Result class, so result data may be accessed like an array \n\n\nDefer execution of operations in taskWriteToFile until the run() method\n\n\nAdd Write::textIfMatch() for taskWriteToFile\n\n\nResourceExistenceChecker used for error checking in DeleteDir, CopyDir, CleanDir and Concat tasks by @burzum\n\n\nProvide ResultData base class for Result; ResultData may be used in instances where a specific \n$task\n instance is not available (e.g. in a Robo command)\n\n\nArgvInput now available via $this-\ngetInput() in RoboFile by Thomas Spigel\n\n\nAdd optional message to git tag task by Tim Tegeler\n\n\nRename 'FileSystem' to 'Filesystem' wherever it occurs.\n\n\nCurrent directory is changed with \nchdir\n only if specified via the \n--load-from\n option (RC2)\n\n\n\n\n0.6.0 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n\nAdded \n--load-from\n option to make Robo start RoboFiles from other directories. Use it like \nrobo --load-from /path/to/where/RobFile/located\n.\n\n\nRobo will not ask to create RoboFile if it does not exist, \ninit\n command should be used.\n\n\n[ImageMinify] task added by @gabor-udvari\n\n\n[OpenBrowser] task added by @oscarotero\n\n\n[FlattenDir] task added by @gabor-udvari\n\n\nRobo Runner can easily extended for custom runner by passing RoboClass and RoboFile parameters to constructor.

            "text": "[Collection] Add tasks to a collection, and implement them as a group with rollback  Tasks may be added to a collection via  $collection- add($task);  $collection- run();  runs all tasks in the collection  $collection- addCode(function () { ... } );  to add arbitrary code to a collection  $collection- progressMessage(...);  will log a message  $collection- rollback($task);  and  $collection- rollbackCode($callable);  add a rollback function to clean up after a failed task  $collection- completion($task);  and  $collection- completionCode($callable);  add a function that is called once the collection completes or rolls back.  $collection- before();  and  $collection- after();  can be used to add a task or function that runs before or after (respectively) the specified named task. To use this feature, tasks must be given names via an optional  $taskName  parameter when they are added.  Collections may be added to collections, if desired.   [CollectionBuilder] Create tasks and add them to a collection in a single operation.  $this- collectionBuilder()- taskExec('pwd')- taskExec('ls')- run()  Add output formatters  If a Robo command returns a string, or a  Result  object with a  $message , then it will be printed  Commands may be annotated to describe output formats that may be used  Structured arrays returned from function results may be converted into different formats, such as a table, yml, json, etc.  Tasks must  use TaskIO  for output methods. It is no longer possible to  use IO  from a task. For direct access use  Robo::output()  (not recommended).     Use league/container to do Dependency Injection  Breaking  Tasks' loadTasks traits must use  $this- task(TaskClass::class);  instead of  new TaskClass();  Breaking  Tasks that use other tasks must use  $this- collectionBuilder()- taskName();  instead of  new TaskClass();  when creating task objects to call. Implement  Robo\\Contract\\BuilderAwareInterface  and use  Robo\\Contract\\BuilderAwareTrait  to add the  collectionBuilder()  method to your task class.  Breaking  The  arg() ,  args()  and  option()  methods in CommandArguments now escape the values passed in to them. There is now a  rawArg()  method if you need to add just one argument that has already been escaped.  Breaking  taskWrite is now called taskWriteToFile  [Extract] task added  [Pack] task added  [TmpDir], [WorkDir] and [TmpFile] tasks added  Support Robo scripts that allows scripts starting with  #!/usr/bin/env robo  to define multiple robo commands.  Use  #!/usr/bin/env robo run  to define a single robo command implemented by the  run()  method.  Provide ProgresIndicatorAwareInterface and ProgressIndicatorAwareTrait that make it easy to add progress indicators to tasks  Add --simulate mode that causes tasks to print what they would have done, but make no changes  Add  robo generate:task  code-generator to make new stack-based task wrappers around existing classes  Add  robo sniff  by @dustinleblanc. Runs the PHP code sniffer followed by the code beautifier, if needed.  Implement ArrayInterface for Result class, so result data may be accessed like an array   Defer execution of operations in taskWriteToFile until the run() method  Add Write::textIfMatch() for taskWriteToFile  ResourceExistenceChecker used for error checking in DeleteDir, CopyDir, CleanDir and Concat tasks by @burzum  Provide ResultData base class for Result; ResultData may be used in instances where a specific  $task  instance is not available (e.g. in a Robo command)  ArgvInput now available via $this- getInput() in RoboFile by Thomas Spigel  Add optional message to git tag task by Tim Tegeler  Rename 'FileSystem' to 'Filesystem' wherever it occurs.  Current directory is changed with  chdir  only if specified via the  --load-from  option (RC2)",
